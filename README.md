# Taxonomy of public services

## Context
Even though the CPSV-AP pushes for the harmonisation between catalogue of public services in Europe, our experience has shown that most of the catalogues and egovernment portals are following different taxonomies or big differences exist in the naming of public services. 
This leads to additional work for harmonising multiple catalogues, for instance for mapping the different terms. While each catalogue of services contains specific services offered to citizens, business and other organisations, generic public services common to most of the catalogues exist but use different names and definitions. A commonly agreed taxonomy of generic public services would help public administrations to align their catalogue of services.

## Objective
To agree on a first level of generic terms for the taxonomy of public services
